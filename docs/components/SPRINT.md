# Sprint Iteration

## Overview

A sprint is a time-boxed iteration in agile development where a team works to complete a set of planned work items. In AgileKit, sprints are the fundamental unit of work organization.

## Sprint Structure

### Duration
- **Standard Range**: 1-4 weeks
- **Recommended**: 2 weeks for most teams
- **Consistency**: Maintain same duration across sprints for better metrics

### Sprint Composition
- **Sprint Goal**: Clear, achievable objective for the sprint
- **Sprint Backlog**: Set of work items (stories, tasks, bugs) committed for completion
- **Team Capacity**: Available team member hours/points
- **Dependencies**: External dependencies identified and managed

## Sprint Lifecycle

### 1. Sprint Planning
**Timing**: First day of sprint  
**Duration**: 2-4 hours (for 2-week sprint)  
**Participants**: Development team, Product Owner, Scrum Master

**Activities**:
- Review and clarify sprint goal
- Select work items from product backlog
- Estimate and commit to sprint backlog
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Break down stories into tasks

**AI Assistance**:
- Historical velocity analysis
- Capacity vs. commitment recommendations
- Risk identification
- Dependency visualization

### 2. Daily Standup
**Timing**: Daily, same time  
**Duration**: 15 minutes maximum  
**Participants**: Development team (Product Owner/Scrum Master optional)

**Format**:
- What did I complete yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- Are there any blockers?

**AI Assistance**:
- Automated status summaries
- Blocker pattern detection
- Progress tracking
- At-risk work item alerts

### 3. Sprint Execution
**Duration**: Majority of sprint  
**Focus**: Deliver committed work items

**Activities**:
- Development and testing
- Code reviews
- Continuous integration
- Backlog refinement (ongoing)
- Stakeholder communication

**AI Assistance**:
- Work item state transitions
- Automated testing integration
- Progress monitoring
- Resource allocation suggestions

### 4. Sprint Review
**Timing**: Last day of sprint  
**Duration**: 1-2 hours (for 2-week sprint)  
**Participants**: Development team, Product Owner, stakeholders

**Activities**:
- Demo completed work
- Gather feedback
- Update product backlog based on feedback
- Review sprint metrics

**AI Assistance**:
- Demo script generation
- Metrics visualization
- Stakeholder feedback collection
- Success criteria validation

### 5. Sprint Retrospective
**Timing**: After sprint review  
**Duration**: 1-1.5 hours (for 2-week sprint)  
**Participants**: Development team, Scrum Master

**Activities**:
- What went well?
- What could be improved?
- What actions will we take?
- Review previous retrospective actions

**AI Assistance**:
- Pattern identification across retrospectives
- Action item tracking
- Sentiment analysis
- Improvement suggestions based on data

## Sprint Metrics

### Velocity
- Story points completed per sprint
- Trend analysis over time
- Capacity planning input

### Burndown Chart
- Work remaining vs. time
- Daily progress tracking
- Early risk identification

### Sprint Commitment
- Committed vs. completed ratio
- Over/under commitment patterns
- Estimation accuracy

### Sprint Health
- Scope creep measurement
- Blocker frequency and duration
- Team satisfaction score

## Sprint States

### Not Started
- Sprint created but not yet begun
- Planning in progress

### Active
- Sprint is in execution phase
- Work in progress

### Completed
- All work done or moved to backlog
- Sprint review and retrospective completed

### Cancelled
- Sprint terminated early (rare)
- Reason documented

## Best Practices

### Planning
- Don't overcommit - leave buffer for unknowns
- Ensure all stories meet Definition of Ready
- Consider team holidays and time off
- Include technical debt and improvements

### Execution
- Update work item status daily
- Flag blockers immediately
- Conduct code reviews promptly
- Maintain focus on sprint goal

### Review
- Demo working software, not slides
- Collect actionable feedback
- Celebrate successes
- Be transparent about misses

### Retrospective
- Create safe environment for honest feedback
- Focus on actionable improvements
- Commit to specific actions
- Review and close previous actions

## Common Pitfalls

### Sprint Planning
- ❌ Selecting too much work
- ❌ Unclear acceptance criteria
- ❌ Not considering dependencies
- ❌ Skipping estimation

### Sprint Execution
- ❌ Scope creep during sprint
- ❌ Not addressing blockers quickly
- ❌ Working in isolation
- ❌ Ignoring sprint goal

### Sprint Review
- ❌ Demoing incomplete work
- ❌ Lack of stakeholder participation
- ❌ Defensive attitude to feedback
- ❌ Skipping metrics review

### Sprint Retrospective
- ❌ Blame culture
- ❌ No action items identified
- ❌ Not tracking action items
- ❌ Same issues recurring
