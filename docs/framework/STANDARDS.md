# AgileKit Framework Standards

## Overview

This document defines the standards that govern the AgileKit framework's operation, ensuring consistency, quality, and interoperability across all components.

## Development Standards

### Code Standards
- Follow language-specific best practices and style guides
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Write self-documenting code with clear intent

### Testing Standards
- Minimum code coverage requirements
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines

### Security Standards
- Secure by default configuration
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Access control and authentication

## Process Standards

### Sprint Standards
- Sprint duration: 1-4 weeks (team-configurable)
- Sprint ceremonies: Planning, Daily Standup, Review, Retrospective
- Sprint goals must be clearly defined and measurable
- Work in progress (WIP) limits respected

### Documentation Standards
- All work items must have clear acceptance criteria
- Technical decisions documented with rationale
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant changes
- User-facing documentation for features

### Communication Standards
- Clear, concise communication in all artifacts
- Standardized templates for work items
- Regular status updates and transparency
- Constructive feedback culture

## Work Item Standards

### Epic Standards
- Strategic alignment documented
- Success metrics defined
- Estimated timeline and resources
- Stakeholder identification

### Feature Standards
- Clear business value statement
- Acceptance criteria defined
- Dependencies identified
- User impact assessment

### User Story Standards
- Follows "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]" format
- Includes acceptance criteria
- Estimated in story points or hours
- Testable and demonstrable

### Task Standards
- Actionable and specific
- Assigned to individual team member
- Time-boxed with realistic estimates
- Linked to parent story or feature

### Bug Standards
- Reproducible steps documented
- Severity and priority assigned
- Environment information included
- Root cause analysis for critical bugs

## Quality Standards

### Definition of Ready (DoR)
Work items are ready for sprint when:
- Clearly described and understood
- Acceptance criteria defined
- Dependencies identified
- Estimated and sized appropriately

### Definition of Done (DoD)
Work items are done when:
- Code complete and reviewed
- Tests written and passing
- Documentation updated
- Acceptance criteria met
- Deployed to appropriate environment

## Metrics and Reporting Standards

### Required Metrics
- Velocity (story points per sprint)
- Cycle time (time from start to completion)
- Lead time (time from creation to completion)
- Defect density
- Sprint commitment vs. completion

### Reporting Cadence
- Daily: Automated status updates
- Sprint: Burndown charts and velocity
- Release: Cumulative metrics and trends
- Quarterly: Strategic alignment review

## Integration Standards

### API Standards
- RESTful design principles
- Versioned endpoints
- Comprehensive error handling
- Rate limiting and throttling

### Data Standards
- Standardized data formats (JSON, YAML)
- Consistent field naming
- Validation at boundaries
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Continuous Improvement

These standards should be reviewed and updated regularly based on:
- Team feedback and retrospectives
- Industry best practices evolution
- Framework performance metrics
- User experience feedback
