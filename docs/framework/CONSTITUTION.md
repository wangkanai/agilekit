# AgileKit Framework Constitution

## Purpose

This constitution defines the foundational principles and governance for the AgileKit framework - an AI-driven system for orchestrating and facilitating software development using agile methodology.

## Core Principles

### 1. AI-Human Collaboration
- AI serves as a facilitator and orchestrator, not a replacement for human decision-making
- Human judgment and creativity remain central to the development process
- AI provides structure, automation, and intelligent assistance

### 2. Agile Methodology Adherence
- Follow established agile practices and principles
- Support iterative and incremental development
- Enable continuous feedback and adaptation

### 3. Transparency and Accountability
- All AI decisions and recommendations must be explainable
- Clear audit trails for all framework activities
- Stakeholder visibility into process and progress

### 4. Flexibility and Extensibility
- Framework must adapt to different team sizes and project types
- Support for customization and extension
- Integration with existing tools and workflows

### 5. Quality and Sustainability
- Promote sustainable development practices
- Enforce quality standards throughout the development lifecycle
- Support long-term maintainability

## Framework Responsibilities

### The Framework SHALL:
1. Provide structure for agile development processes
2. Facilitate communication and coordination
3. Track and manage work items (epics, features, stories, tasks, bugs)
4. Support sprint planning and execution
5. Enable metrics and reporting
6. Maintain consistency across teams and projects

### The Framework SHALL NOT:
1. Make business decisions without human input
2. Override human judgment on critical matters
3. Access or modify production systems without explicit authorization
4. Share confidential information outside authorized boundaries

## Governance

### Decision Authority
- Strategic decisions: Product Owner / Stakeholders
- Technical decisions: Development Team with AI recommendations
- Process decisions: Scrum Master / Team Lead with AI support

### Modification Process
This constitution may be modified through:
1. Proposal by any stakeholder
2. Review by framework maintainers
3. Consensus approval by governance committee
4. Version-controlled documentation update

## Compliance

All components of the AgileKit framework must comply with this constitution. Non-compliance should be reported and addressed promptly.
