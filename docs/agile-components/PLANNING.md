# Planning

## Overview

Planning in AgileKit encompasses multiple levels of planning activities that occur throughout the agile development lifecycle, from strategic roadmap planning to tactical sprint planning.

## Planning Levels

### 1. Product Roadmap Planning
**Timeframe**: 6-12 months  
**Frequency**: Quarterly or bi-annually  
**Participants**: Product leadership, stakeholders

**Purpose**:
- Define product vision and strategy
- Identify major themes and initiatives
- Allocate resources across epics
- Set success metrics

**Artifacts**:
- Product roadmap
- Strategic themes
- High-level timelines
- Resource allocation plan

### 2. Release Planning
**Timeframe**: 2-6 months  
**Frequency**: Per release cycle  
**Participants**: Product Owner, development team, stakeholders

**Purpose**:
- Define release goals and scope
- Sequence epics and features
- Identify dependencies
- Set release dates

**Artifacts**:
- Release plan
- Feature breakdown
- Dependency map
- Risk register

### 3. Sprint Planning
**Timeframe**: 1-4 weeks  
**Frequency**: Beginning of each sprint  
**Participants**: Development team, Product Owner, Scrum Master

**Purpose**:
- Define sprint goal
- Select and commit to work items
- Break down stories into tasks
- Identify sprint-level risks

**Artifacts**:
- Sprint backlog
- Task breakdown
- Capacity allocation
- Sprint goal statement

## Planning Ceremonies

### Backlog Refinement
**Duration**: 1-2 hours per week  
**Participants**: Development team, Product Owner

**Activities**:
- Review upcoming backlog items
- Add detail and acceptance criteria
- Estimate work items
- Split large stories
- Remove outdated items

**AI Assistance**:
- Suggest story splitting
- Estimate based on historical data
- Identify missing details
- Highlight dependencies

### Capacity Planning
**Timing**: Before sprint planning  
**Participants**: Development team, Scrum Master

**Activities**:
- Calculate available team hours
- Account for holidays and time off
- Consider team member skills
- Determine sustainable pace

**AI Assistance**:
- Historical capacity analysis
- Team member allocation
- Skill matrix matching
- Load balancing recommendations

## Planning Techniques

### Story Mapping
- Visualize user journey
- Organize stories by user activities
- Prioritize by user value
- Identify MVP scope

### MoSCoW Prioritization
- **Must have**: Critical features
- **Should have**: Important but not critical
- **Could have**: Desirable if time permits
- **Won't have**: Out of scope for this release

### Planning Poker
- Team-based estimation technique
- Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- Consensus building
- Knowledge sharing

### Dependency Mapping
- Identify inter-team dependencies
- Map technical dependencies
- Sequence work appropriately
- Manage external dependencies

## Planning Best Practices

### Product Roadmap
- Keep it flexible and adaptive
- Focus on outcomes, not outputs
- Communicate regularly with stakeholders
- Review and adjust quarterly

### Release Planning
- Include buffer for unknowns
- Plan for technical debt reduction
- Consider architectural improvements
- Validate dependencies early

### Sprint Planning
- Don't over-commit
- Ensure Definition of Ready is met
- Break down large items
- Consider team velocity trends

### Backlog Management
- Keep top items refined and ready
- Maintain clear priorities
- Remove stale items regularly
- Include non-functional requirements

## Planning Anti-Patterns

### Roadmap Planning
- ❌ Setting dates too far in advance
- ❌ Ignoring technical debt
- ❌ Over-committing resources
- ❌ Not involving development team

### Release Planning
- ❌ Scope creep without timeline adjustment
- ❌ Not validating dependencies
- ❌ Ignoring team capacity
- ❌ No contingency planning

### Sprint Planning
- ❌ Selecting work without team input
- ❌ Not breaking down stories
- ❌ Unclear sprint goal
- ❌ Ignoring historical velocity

### Backlog Refinement
- ❌ Not refining regularly
- ❌ Too much detail too early
- ❌ Unclear priorities
- ❌ Technical jargon in user stories
