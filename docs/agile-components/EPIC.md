# Epic

## Overview

An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller work items (features, user stories). Epics represent significant initiatives that align with strategic business goals and typically span multiple sprints or releases.

## Epic Characteristics

### Size and Scope
- **Duration**: Typically 1-6 months
- **Team Impact**: May involve multiple teams
- **Business Value**: Significant impact on users or business
- **Complexity**: Too large to complete in a single sprint

### Strategic Alignment
- Supports product vision and roadmap
- Addresses key business objectives
- Delivers measurable outcomes
- Creates competitive advantage

## Epic Structure

- Problem statement
- Target users or customers
- Expected outcomes

#### 3. Business Value
- Quantifiable benefits
- Strategic importance
- User impact
- Revenue or cost implications

#### 4. Success Metrics
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Acceptance thresholds
- Measurement approach
- Timeline for evaluation

#### 5. Stakeholders
- Executive sponsor
- Product owner
- Affected teams
- External dependencies

### Optional Elements

#### Dependencies
- Other epics or initiatives
- Technical infrastructure
- External vendors or partners
- Regulatory requirements

#### Risks and Assumptions
- Technical risks
- Market risks
- Resource constraints
- Critical assumptions

#### Timeline
- Target start date

- Key milestones
- Phase breakdown

## Epic Lifecycle

### 1. Ideation
**Status**: Draft  
**Activities**:
- Capture initial concept
- Identify business opportunity
- Gather stakeholder input
- Assess strategic fit

### 2. Refinement
**Status**: Proposed  
**Activities**:
- Develop detailed description
- Define success metrics
- Estimate effort and value
- Identify dependencies

### 3. Approval
**Status**: Approved  
**Activities**:
- Present to stakeholders
- Secure funding/resources
- Prioritize in roadmap
- Assign ownership

### 4. Breakdown
**Status**: In Progress  
**Activities**:
- Decompose into features
- Create user stories
- Sequence work
- Plan releases

### 5. Execution
**Status**: Active  
**Activities**:
- Track feature completion
- Monitor progress
- Manage scope
- Report status

### 6. Completion
**Status**: Done  
**Activities**:
- Validate success metrics
- Document outcomes
- Capture lessons learned
- Archive or retire

## Epic Decomposition

### Breaking Down Epics

#### Level 1: Features
- Major functional areas
- User-facing capabilities
- Technical components
- Example: "Product Search", "Shopping Cart", "Checkout"

#### Level 2: User Stories
- Specific user capabilities
- Single sprint scope
- Testable and demonstrable
- Example: "As a shopper, I can search by price range"

#### Level 3: Tasks
- Implementation activities
- Hours-based estimates
- Assigned to individuals
- Example: "Create price filter UI component"

### Decomposition Strategies

#### By User Persona
- Segment by user type
- Focus on specific user needs
- Enable parallel development

#### By Functionality
- Group related features
- Logical feature sets
- Progressive enhancement

#### By Technical Layer
- Frontend, backend, data
- Enables specialist teams
- Consider integration complexity

#### By Release Phase
- MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Enhanced features
- Advanced capabilities

## Epic Management

### Planning
- **Roadmap Placement**: Quarter or release alignment
- **Resource Allocation**: Team assignments and capacity
- **Dependency Management**: Identify and track blockers
- **Risk Mitigation**: Contingency planning

### Tracking
- **Progress Monitoring**: Feature completion percentage
- **Metrics Dashboard**: KPIs and success criteria
- **Status Reporting**: Regular updates to stakeholders
- **Scope Management**: Control feature creep

### Communication
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Regular progress reports
- **Team Coordination**: Cross-team alignment
- **Change Management**: Impact of scope changes
- **Success Celebration**: Milestone achievements

## Epic Best Practices

### Writing Epics
- Focus on business outcomes, not technical solutions
- Make business value explicit and measurable
- Include clear success criteria
- Keep description concise but comprehensive

### Sizing Epics
- Not too small (should be >1 sprint)
- Not too large (should complete within 6 months)
- Consider splitting very large epics
- Balance granularity with overhead

### Prioritizing Epics
- Align with strategic objectives
- Consider business value vs. effort
- Account for dependencies
- Balance quick wins with long-term investments

### Managing Epics
- Review progress regularly
- Adjust scope as needed
- Communicate changes transparently
- Celebrate incremental successes

## Epic Anti-Patterns

### Definition Issues
- ❌ Vague or unclear description
- ❌ No measurable success criteria
- ❌ Technical implementation instead of business outcome
- ❌ Unclear stakeholder or owner

### Scope Issues
- ❌ Too broad (never-ending epic)
- ❌ Too narrow (really just a feature)
- ❌ Scope creep without re-evaluation
- ❌ No clear boundaries

### Management Issues
- ❌ Set and forget (no active tracking)
- ❌ No regular status updates
- ❌ Ignoring dependencies
- ❌ Not adjusting to changing priorities
